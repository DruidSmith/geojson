# GeoJSON
=======

This is just a collection of tests and experiments dealing with GeoJSON, to include styling via MapBox symbol sets.

## Useful Resources:

- GeoJSON Project and Specifications: http://geojson.org/
- GeoJSON Lint - validator and previewer for GeoJSON: http://geojsonlint.com/
- MapBox Maki symbol set: http://www.mapbox.com/maki/ - note that not all symbols are supported in github; for example, land-use does not appear to work
